## Available Today

- X/Twitter and LinkedIn prospect discovery, enrichment, and approval-first outreach workflows.
- Image, GIF, and video uploads stored in a reusable media library.
- Agent access to selected media attachments for drafting X and LinkedIn replies and messages.
- Platform-aware validation for attachment types, counts, combinations, and file sizes.

## Now

### Reliability And Quality

- Improve reliability across existing X and LinkedIn workflows.
- Reduce rough edges in onboarding, local setup, and developer experience.
- Add stronger coverage for tests, error states, fallbacks, and operational diagnostics.
- Use tools such as React Doctor, Convex tooling, linting, audits, and targeted tests to make the codebase more robust and reliable.

### Evaluations And Benchmarks

- Build benchmarks for discovery quality.
- Build benchmarks for qualification quality.
- Build benchmarks for enrichment usefulness.
- Build benchmarks for outreach and plan quality.
- Make agent performance measurable over time instead of relying on intuition.

## Next

### Email Integration

Let users send emails directly from ReacherX.

Desired product shape:

- Users can write and send emails manually in the UI.
- Users can ask the agent to draft and send emails for them.
- ReacherX should support agent-assisted email workflows in the same spirit as existing social actions.

### Calendar Integration

Integrate Google Calendar and Outlook Calendar so users can book calls and meetings from inside ReacherX.

Desired product shape:

- Show calendar capabilities in the UI.
- Let users manually schedule meetings through the product.
- Let users ask the agent to book calls and meetings for them.
- Treat calendar actions similarly to other ReacherX actions: clear UX, clear control, agent-assisted execution.

### Cross-Platform Identity Resolution

Find the same prospect across multiple channels and surface that clearly in the product.

Desired product shape:

- Detect when multiple accounts belong to the same person.
- Show which platforms that person is on inside the prospect profile panel.
- Make that cross-channel view useful for research, outreach planning, and action selection.

### App-Originated Email Delivery

- Send product emails to users.
- Support workflow-driven notifications and lifecycle emails.
- Improve delivery and reliability for important product communication.

### Documents And Richer Artifact Reasoning

- Add PDF, document, spreadsheet, and presentation uploads.
- Extract useful content and metadata from uploaded artifacts.
- Let the agent safely reason over and act on those additional file types.

## Later

### More Platforms

- Reddit
- Bluesky
- Threads

### Sub-Agents And Agent Swarms

- Spawn sub-agents in parallel.
- Let specialized agents complete different actions or research tasks at the same time.
- Explore swarm-style execution for bigger workflows.

## Help Wanted

These are especially good areas for contributors, after alignment:

- evaluations and benchmarks
- local-dev experience
- docs and contributor onboarding
- platform integrations
- identity resolution
- frontend polish and accessibility
- observability, robustness, and testing
