  {
    id: "why-agent",
    question: "Why do you call ReacherX an Agent?",
    answer:
      "Because it does more than search. It keeps running in the background, qualifies people, reads context, drafts outreach, and improves from your feedback.",
  },
  {
    id: "how-does-it-know",
    question: "How does ReacherX know who to reach?",
    answer:
      "You tell Agent who you want to reach in plain English, or give it a URL. It turns that into search strategies, watches for real signals, and qualifies people based on fit and context.",

  {
    id: "platform-support",
    question: "Which platforms does ReacherX support?",

  },
  {
    id: "different-from-other-tools",
    question: "How is ReacherX different from other outreach tools?",
    answer:
      "Most tools help you build lists or automate sequences. ReacherX is an open-source Agent that works from live social context, learns over time, and helps you reach the right people with more relevance.",
  },
  {
