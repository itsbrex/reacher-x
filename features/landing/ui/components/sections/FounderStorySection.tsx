            I started ReacherX because ads felt broken. The people you need
            already exist, posting their problems, asking for help, and looking
            for what you&apos;re building. They are not missing. They are just
            hard to find.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
            Three years in, it has been harder than I imagined. But I&apos;m
            still here, still building, still shipping.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
            ReacherX is open source because I believe in Open Source as a
            philosophy; the best tools are built in the open. If it helps you
            find the people you need, the effort is worth it.
