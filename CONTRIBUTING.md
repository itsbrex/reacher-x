# Contributing to ReacherX

Thanks for wanting to contribute.

ReacherX is an open-source agent product focused on finding the right people, building context around them, and helping users take action through the UI or through the agent itself. If you want to improve the product, fix something broken, or help shape the roadmap, you are in the right place.

## Before You Start

Please contact Salman before working on:

- new features
- roadmap items
- major UX changes
- agent behavior changes
- architecture changes
- integration work

That is important here because feature work usually benefits from brainstorming first.

Reach out here:

- Email: [creativecoder.crco@gmail.com](mailto:creativecoder.crco@gmail.com)
- Discord: [discord.gg/76dF9NPH](https://discord.gg/76dF9NPH)
- LinkedIn: [linkedin.com/in/noobships](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noobships)
- GitHub Issues: [github.com/VecterAI/reacher-x/issues](https://github.com/VecterAI/reacher-x/issues)

Small bug fixes, typo fixes, and focused polish PRs are fine without a long pre-discussion.

## Fastest Ways To Help

- Fix docs that are unclear or outdated.
- Improve accessibility and responsive behavior.
- Tighten loading states, empty states, and error states.
- Add or improve tests.
- Improve local setup and contributor onboarding.
- Work on a roadmap item after checking in first.

## Local Setup

Use Node.js 22+ with pnpm 11.x. The repo is pinned to pnpm 11 in `package.json`, so Corepack is the simplest way to stay aligned.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VecterAI/reacher-x.git
cd reacher-x
corepack enable pnpm
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npx convex dev --once
```

After the one-time Convex validation succeeds, run the development processes in separate terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Convex backend watcher
npx convex dev
```

```bash
# Terminal 2: Next.js frontend
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Environment Expectations

Use `.env.example` as the local template and follow [docs/configuration.md](./docs/configuration.md) for the complete setup. Next.js reads `.env.local`, while Convex backend variables are configured per deployment with `npx convex env set`.

Depending on what you work on, you may need:

- Convex configuration
- WorkOS configuration
- AI provider keys
- X/Twitter credentials
- LinkedIn provider credentials
- Email provider configuration
- Billing configuration

You only need the provider credentials for the feature area you are developing. Do not upload the whole `.env.local` file to Convex: it contains frontend and local-only values as well as secrets intended for other runtimes.

## How The Codebase Is Organized

- `app/`: route structure and page-level entry points.
- `features/`: product features and UI modules.
- `shared/`: shared UI, hooks, types, and utilities.
- `convex/agents/tools/`: thin tool wrappers exposed to agents.
- `convex/workflows/`: orchestration, retries, durable flows.
- `convex/lib/`: core business logic and reusable backend helpers.

## Core Repo Rules

Read [`agents.md`](./agents.md) before making architectural assumptions.

Important rules:

- Search for existing helpers before adding new ones.
- Reuse shared utilities instead of creating one-off logic.
- Follow the 3-layer Convex architecture.
- `convex/agents/tools/` for thin tool wrappers
- `convex/workflows/` for orchestration
- `convex/lib/*Core.ts` for business logic
- Keep agent tools thin.
- Use the existing validators, type guards, and helper patterns when available.

## Best Contribution Paths

### Frontend

- loading states
- accessibility
- responsive behavior
- profile panel improvements
- composer experience
- discoverability and clarity in the UI

### Backend

- workflow reliability
- platform integrations
- queueing and retry behavior
- data contracts
- webhook robustness

### Agent and AI

- prompt and tool UX improvements
- evaluations and benchmark coverage
- memory quality
- plan quality
- guardrails and review flows

### Product Infrastructure

- local-dev ergonomics
- docs quality
- email delivery flows
- observability and diagnostics

## Roadmap And Help Wanted

The active roadmap lives in [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md).

Especially valuable areas:

- Email integration so users can send emails directly from ReacherX through the UI or through the agent.
- Calendar integration for Google Calendar and Outlook Calendar so users can book meetings manually in the UI or by asking the agent.
- Cross-platform identity resolution so a single prospect can be seen across multiple social channels in the profile panel.
- Additional platforms such as Reddit, Bluesky, and Threads.
- Evaluations, benchmarks, and performance measurement for agent quality.
- Sub-agents and agent swarms for parallel task execution.
- PDF, document, spreadsheet, and presentation extraction for richer agent workflows. Image, GIF, and video attachments are already supported.
- Reliability and optimization work using tools such as React Doctor, Convex tooling, linting, audits, and stronger automated testing.

If you want to work on any of the items above, please contact Salman first so you can align on approach and product intent.

## How To Propose Work

### Small Changes

For typo fixes, targeted bug fixes, and small polish improvements:

- open a PR directly, or
- open a quick issue first if you want feedback before implementing

### Bigger Changes

For features, roadmap items, integrations, or architectural work:

- open an issue, and
- message Salman directly by email or Discord so you can brainstorm together before implementation

## PR Checklist

Before opening a PR:

- explain what changed
- explain why it changed
- mention any env var, schema, or integration impact
- include screenshots for UI changes
- run the checks that apply

Useful commands:

```bash
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm lint:strict
pnpm exec prettier --check path/to/changed-file
pnpm test:convex
pnpm build
```

Run the focused test commands that cover your change as well. Keep editor/LSP diagnostics clean for every touched code file.
