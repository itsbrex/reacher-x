## ▪️ Development Workflow

### Development Steps

| **Step** | **Action**                                              | **Notes**                          |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------- |
| `1.`     | **Fork the repo**                                       | -                                  |
| `2.`     | **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b fix/your-feature` | Use descriptive branch names       |
| `3.`     | **Make changes**                                        | Follow code style guidelines below |
| `4.`     | **Test locally**: Run the app and verify it works       | `pnpm dev`                         |
| `5.`     | **Check code quality**: Run linting                     | `pnpm lint`                        |
| `6.`     | **Commit and push**                                     | Write clear commit messages        |
| `7.`     | **Create PR**                                           | Fill out the PR template           |

### Local Development

**Always run these before committing:**

```bash
# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Check for linting issues
pnpm lint

# Build to ensure everything compiles
pnpm build
```

**If you have linting issues, try:**

```bash
# Auto-fix linting issues (if possible)
pnpm lint --fix
```

### Code Style

- **Prettier** handles formatting (configured in `.prettierrc`)
- **ESLint** with TypeScript support catches issues (configured in `eslint.config.mjs`)
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions

**General guidelines:**

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React best practices (hooks, functional components)
- Keep components small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## ▪️ What Happens When You Submit a PR

1. **Code review** - I'll review your changes for logic, style, and best practices
2. **Testing** - Make sure your changes work as expected
3. **Merge** - Once approved, your PR will be merged!

### PR Guidelines

- **Keep PRs focused** - One feature or fix per PR
- **Write clear descriptions** - Explain what you changed and why
- **Link related issues** - Reference any issues your PR addresses
- **Test your changes** - Make sure everything works locally

## ▪️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"pnpm install fails"**

- Ensure you're using Node.js 20.0.0+ and pnpm 9.15.4+
- Try `pnpm install --force` to refresh dependencies
- Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml && pnpm install`

**"Convex connection fails"**

- Make sure you've run `npx convex dev` and have `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` in your `.env.local`
- Check that your Convex deployment is active

**"API errors"**

- Verify all required API keys are set in `.env.local`
- Check that API keys are valid and have proper permissions
- See `.env.example` for all required variables

**"Build fails"**

- Run `pnpm lint` to check for linting issues
- Ensure TypeScript types are correct: check for type errors in your editor
- Try `pnpm build` to see specific error messages

**"Can't find module"**

- Make sure you've run `pnpm install`
- Check that you're using the correct import paths
- Verify the file exists in the expected location
