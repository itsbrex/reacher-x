## ▪️ What is ReacherX?

ReacherX is an AI agent that finds people on X (Twitter) and LinkedIn, qualifies them against your criteria, enriches their profiles, learns your writing voice, and helps you engage with personalized outreach — all from a chat interface. You describe who you're looking for, and the agent handles discovery, qualification, enrichment, plan generation, and execution.

It adapts to whatever "reaching the right people" means for you:

| Use Case                     | Who You Find                                          | Success Looks Like     |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Customer Prospecting**     | People actively expressing a need your product solves | Converts               |
| **Recruiting**               | Candidates matching your open roles                   | Hires                  |
| **Partnership Outreach**     | Companies or operators for strategic partnerships     | Active partners        |
| **Investor Outreach**        | Investors whose thesis fits your opportunity          | Committed investors    |
| **User Research**            | Participants who can give useful product feedback     | Confirmed participants |
| **Creator Outreach**         | Creators who match your audience or brand             | Collaborators          |
| **Community Growth**         | People likely to join and participate                 | Members                |
| **Podcast Speaker Sourcing** | Guests with the right expertise and voice             | Booked guests          |

Each use case shapes the entire experience — search queries, qualification criteria, pipeline stages, outreach tone, UI labels, and analytics are all tailored.

   Agent generates search queries tailored to X and LinkedIn
        │
        ▼
   Finds matching people across both platforms
        │
        ▼
   Qualifies each person (ICP fit, engagement quality, authenticity)
        │
        ▼
   Enriches profiles (pain points, financial signals, professional context)
        │
        ▼
   Agent generates a personalized outreach plan

   Agent learns from outcomes and improves over time
```

## ▪️ Features

### Two-Agent System

ReacherX runs two specialized agents:

**Setup Agent** — Handles onboarding and workspace creation. Analyzes your URL, generates your ICP, converts keywords into social search queries, and kicks off discovery.

**Outreach Agent** — Takes over once prospects are found. Fetches social context, generates engagement plans, drafts replies/DMs in your voice, and executes approved actions.

Both agents work through a chat interface with streaming responses, tool execution visualization, and inline cards for approvals, previews, and plan display.

### Inline Autocomplete

Tab-complete for your replies and DMs — similar to Cursor's tab completion. The autocomplete is context-aware:

- Knows who you're replying to and what they said
- Respects character limits (X post weighted length vs raw)
- Matches your writing style when a style profile exists
- Adapts to workspace context and prospect information
- Shows as ghost text, accept with Tab

### Writing Style Learning

The agent learns how you write by analyzing your posts on X and LinkedIn. It distills your vocabulary, sentence structure, humor, formality, emoji usage, opening/closing patterns, strengths, and weaknesses into a writing style profile. This profile is automatically applied when the agent drafts replies, DMs, and outreach content — so everything sounds like you, not a bot.

Style profiles are stored per-workspace and per-platform (Twitter vs LinkedIn).

### Memory System

The agent builds workspace-level memory across 8 categories:

- **Qualification win patterns** — Signals that predict a good fit
- **Qualification false positive patterns** — Signals to avoid
- **Enrichment signal patterns** — Useful bio/post/financial indicators
- **Enrichment role patterns** — Recurring personas that matter
- **Outreach winning patterns** — Approaches that work
- **Outreach objection patterns** — Approaches to avoid
- **Writing style profiles** — Your voice on Twitter and LinkedIn

Memory is backed by vector search (RAG) for semantic retrieval. The agent queries relevant memories before generating plans or drafting content, and writes new memories as it learns from outcomes.

### Social Actions (Human-in-the-Loop)

The agent can execute actions on both platforms with a risk-based approval policy:

**X (Twitter):**

- Low-risk (immediate): Like, unlike, bookmark
- Medium-risk (approval required): Retweet, follow, unfollow
- High-risk (approval required): Reply, create post, send DM

**LinkedIn:**

- All approval required: Send message, invite, react, comment

Every medium and high-risk action goes through approval — the agent stages the draft, you review it, then it executes.

### Agent Ops Dashboard

A full operations dashboard with 5 tabs to monitor how the agent is performing:

- **Overview** — Health score, quality score, funnel metrics, best/weakest queries
- **Discovery** — Query inventory with performance scores, monitor health, novelty yield
- **Quality** — Qualification precision, enrichment usefulness, outreach effectiveness, correction trends
- **Memory** — Stored memories, confidence scores, impact scores, recent promotions
- **Activity** — Event feed, running/failed workflows, pending evaluations

### Discovery & Monitoring

- AI-generated search queries from your ICP description
- Real-time monitoring via SocialAPI webhooks — new results trigger automatic processing
- Query candidate tracking with performance scoring (prospects found, qualified, converted, reply rate)
- Conversation seed monitors that detect when prospects reply to your engagement
- Discovery trace that tracks how each prospect was found (which query, which platform, which monitor)

### Pipeline Management

Track people through stages adapted to your use case:

- Customer Prospecting: New → Contacted → In Progress → Converted
- Recruiting: Sourced → Contacted → Interviewing → Hired
- Partnership Outreach: Identified → Contacted → Negotiating → Partnered
- _(each use case has its own stage labels)_

### Multi-Platform Support

**X (Twitter)** — Full support: search, profile lookup, thread analysis, replies, likes, retweets, DMs, real-time monitoring, conversation tracking.

**LinkedIn** — Search, profile enrichment, post analysis, messages, invitations, reactions, comments via Unipile and LinkdAPI.

### Other Features

- **Prospect enrichment** — Type detection, pain point extraction, solution matching, financial signals
- **AI qualification** — ICP fit scoring (0-100), bot detection, engagement quality assessment
- **Analytics dashboard** — Discovery metrics, outreach metrics, engagement tracking, funnel visualization
- **Notifications** — Prospect found, outreach sent, approval requests, response alerts
- **Billing** — Subscription management via Polar with plan limits
- **Workspace management** — Multiple workspaces, each with its own use case, ICP, and pipeline
